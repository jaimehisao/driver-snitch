## Introduction
Do you ever wonder if you are driving around responsible people? Do you sometimes wonder if this people have outstanding tickets in their cars?
Driving Snitch does just that, it reads licence plates and checks a publicly available database to see if the car has any outstanding tickets in a given municipality.

## How does it work?
The software scans the cars plates using a front camera and then the software uses Web Scraping to fetch the cars ticket data, this data is then processed and shown to the end user as a video overlay or a text-based output. 

## Why?
For no actual good reason, just to learn about OCR, OpenCV, Python and Web Scraping.


## Current Software Restrictions
- The database where tickets are queried against only works in Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico.


## Warnings and Disclaimers
I'm not responsible for any misuse of this software in any way, shape or form. While driving always keep your eyes on the road and not in your device(s).
