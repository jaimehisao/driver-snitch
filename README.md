# driver-snitch

## Introduction
Do you ever wonder if you are driving around responsible people? Maybe even know if this people have outstanding tickets in their cars?
Driving Snitch does just that, by reading other licence plates and checking a publicly available database to see if the car has any outstanding tickets in the given municipality.

The software scans the cars plates using a front camera and then the software uses webscraping to fetch the cars ticket data, this data is then processed and shown to the end user as a video overlay or a text-based output.


## Current Software Restrictions
- The database that this program uses only works in Mexico.
